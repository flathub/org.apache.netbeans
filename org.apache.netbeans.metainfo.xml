    <release version="12.1" date="2020-10-03">
      <description>
        Jakarta EE 8

        Ability to create a Jakarta EE 8 project
        Change an existing Maven web application to Jakarta EE 8.

    C/C++

    Rudimentary C/C++ feature integration, which does not have as many features as the 8.2 C/C++ support, in other words, this is not fully featured, but it could help some of our users until the full support is complete. When 8.2 C/C++ plugins are installed, they should take precedence in 12.1.

        Rudimentary C/C++ project that allows the user to provide commands for the build/run actions and some additional settings.

        Syntax highlighting using TextMate grammars.

        Code completion and other editing support is through the Language Server Protocol, using the ccls language server, which the users need to provide themselves;

        A *very* rudimentary debugger using gdb (based on the Ant debugger, and gdb interface from CND).

    More details: https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2234
    Gradle

        Gradle is enabled with Java SE
        Added support for Generated Directories and proper handling of  annotation processors

    PHP

        Add new actions for Composer (https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2173)
        Show `false` and `true` instead of `0` and `1` as boolean values in the Variables window of the debugger (https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2178)
        Improve/Fix code analysis features(e.g.https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2246, https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2249)

    HTML

        Update the validator.jar (https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2217) It would be great if someone verifies it.
        Enable the code template completion (https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2253)
        Code completion and syntax highlighting for(https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2184)

    CSS

        Add formatting options (https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/2257) only "Tabs And Indents"
